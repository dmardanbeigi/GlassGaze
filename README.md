WHAT IS GAZE GLASS?
--------------
GlassGaze is a client for the open source Haytham gaze tracker <Eye.itu.dk>. This app allows you to do eye tracking and gaze tracking on Google Glass. It allows the Glass to know where exactly you are looking at inside the display and even in your field of view. Now you can interact with Glass by your eyes!

GlassGaze is an android app designed for Google Glass that makes it possible to do gaze tracking on the Glass. It allows the Google Glass to know where exactly you are looking at. You can interact with the head-mounted display with you eyes. With GlassGaze, your google Glass not only knows where and what point in the display you are looking at but also knows where you are looking in your field view. Now, not only you can take picture or video with your Glass but also you can record your gaze point inside the image and video and share them with your friends. It would be very interesting for your friends to know what you where you were watching in front of you!

GlassGaze is actually a client for the Haytham gaze tracker. Both the Haytham gaze tracker and the GlassGaze client are freeware and open-source. You just need to attach a small camera to the Google Glass frame to capture the eye image. The camera send the image to a remote computer that the Haytham gaze tracker is runnign on it. All the eye tracking processing will be done in the computer and the gaze data will be sent to the Glass through Wifi. The need for a remote computer for the main processing in our first prototype is due to the low processing power and limited battery life of the current Google Glasses.

GlassGaze actually provides a basic framework for experiencing the eye and gaze tracking on the Google Glass. The gaze data streamed by the Haytham gaze tracker will be received by the GlassGaze app. The app facilitate the user to calibrate the system for both gaze tracking while watching the display and while viewing the scene. Besides the demo apps inside the application that show the main features of the app, as an developer you have access to the gaze tracking data from other applications running on the Glass!
